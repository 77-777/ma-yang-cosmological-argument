### Ma Yang's Cosmological Argument

1. The world exists. At least, from what we seem to experience from our **conciousness***.
2. It is questionable whether it is possible for the world to not have existed. Or whether this world is merely in our own **minds***.

---

3. There exists some reason why there is anything at all, as opposed as to why there isn't. This reason is unknown.
4. At some point in time, a **cause*** brought the world into existence (be it the big bang, panspermia, etc)
5. Science provides us a current phenomenon where **Creatio ex nihilo*** is possible, through **Quantum Fluctuations.***

---

6. Seemingly, it appears the world seems to follow a **physicalism*** prospect; as such, "supernatural" miracles are usually discarded.
7. Considering probability, entropy and the Boltzmann Brain argument, it is pretty concrete that it is possible for a complex entity to arise given absurd amounts of trials and time.
8. Following this logic, it is highly likely that **abiogenesis*** and **symbiogenesis*** occured, creating life out of non-living material, followed by protocells and later eukaryote and prokaryote cells, the very basis of all our tissue.

---

9. It is difficult to define what exactly metaphysical entities are, whether they're some form of matter or metamatter, such as time, abstract entities, shapes and qualia.
10. Such entities exist in our world despite having no particular physical entity.
11. It is highly possible that there may be other entities that are metaphysical to the world.

---

8. There is no evidence of divine intervention that is captured as a primary source.
9. If a complex entity is possible to arrise as a result of the Boltzmann Brain theory, then it is also possible for a deity to have arised.
10. Evidence of such a deity does not exist.
11. Evidence of a higher form of deity's involvement in our world does not seem to exist.

---

12. The existence of a deity conflicts with the current state of the world and life's toils.
13. The absence of a deity conflicts with the current state of the world and life's toils.
14. The possibility that a deity can exist is likely, but did not form (or no evidence is found) provides a case of questionable state.

---

15. Concluding from all arguments presented so far, if there is a deity, then it has to be external to this universe.
16. If there isn't a deity, the reason for the existence of our universe has to be external to this universe.
17. Infinite regress to the physical world doesn't seem to make sense as it is merely conceptual.
